Your task is to develop a reusable UI component that retrieves JSON data from a given URL and shows it in a tree view where nodes can be expanded and collapsed.

The component should be able to handle any valid JSON, without any expectations regarding its structure.

To clarify, please don't rely on a 3rd party component to render the tree, but rather implement a simple tree using basic HTML/CSS building blocks.

The page that contains the component must be able to control the URL from which the data is obtained. The URL is assumed to be publicly available without authentication. Changing the URL should fetch the data and update accordingly.

The choice of visual style and technology stack is up to you.
